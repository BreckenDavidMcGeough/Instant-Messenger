You should have received a detailed handout for this project.  Be sure
to read it, as well as all of the given code in `src/`, before you
begin working.

Repository Layout
---

The files `src/pack.c` and `src/unpack.c` will contain your
implementation of your encode and decode functions respectively.  They
currently have only empty functions and comments to help you get
started.

As usual, this README and the project Makefile are in the top-level
directory.  For this project you will not want to modify your
Makefile or add any new source files.

Also in the top level directory is the server binary,
`chat_server`. You will need to run this according to the handout to
run your code.

Submission
---

Per usual, `make submission` will create the file `submission.tar` to be
submitted to Autograder.
